				<section id="sc1" class="">
					<h2>Basics</h2>
					
					<p>I'm fluent in the best practices of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I can implement advanced but eloquent code that's reusable, DRY, and well documented.</p>
					<p>Complementary to these languages, I have a comprehensive understanding of client-server communication, particularly the details of communication over HTTP as well as Sockets.</p>
					<p>I'm knowledgeable in each step from developing to deploying a site, including some often neglected parts like setting up correct DNS settings, declaring canonical URLs, sitemaps, robots.txt, and more.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="sc2" class="">
					<h2>Frontend</h2>

					<p>Frontend development is thrilling. I get to create something that anyone in the world can visit and interact with. I'm driven to make sites that are responsive and accessible to everyone.</p>

					<h3 id="sc21">Libraries</h3>

					<h4>JQuery <span class="skill-subhead">4 years</span></h4>
					<p>I use JQuery in most projects I work on, however I'm trying to use it less as more browsers support better native functionality in vanilla Javascript.</p>
					<p>For example, the bubbles in the background of the main page on this site are animated using native JS that manipulates CSS transforms, which sped up the previous JQuery version by about 5 times.</p>

					<h4>ReactJS <span class="skill-subhead">1 year (Learning)</span></h4>
					<p>I've been learning React for about a year now, and I'll likely start using it on a project later this year.</p>

					<h3 id="sc22">Frameworks</h3>

					<h4>Bootstrap <span class="skill-subhead">3 years</span></h4>
					<p>I've been using Bootstrap in about three quarters of all projects I've work on.</p>

					<h4>AngularJS (1.3) <span class="skill-subhead">2 years</span></h4>
					<p>AngularJS has been one of my favorite frameworks because of it's paradigm.</p>
					<p>I'm currently learning AngularJS v2</p>
					
					<h4>Cordova <span class="skill-subhead">3 years</span></h4>
					<p>I've built various experiments with PhoneGap, and now with NativeScript. I haven't found a project to use it on yet.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="sc3" class="">
					<h2>Backend</h2>
					<p>Backend development appeals to my appreciation for efficiency and structure. To date, I've built and launched 5 servers, all built from the ground up.</p>

					<h3 id="sc31">Server Development</h3>
					<h4>NodeJS <span class="skill-subhead">2 years</span></h4>
					<p>NodeJS, with ExpressJS, is my go-to setup for running a server. I've used it with both MongoDB and PostgreSQL.</p>
					<h4>Flask (Python) <span class="skill-subhead">(Learning)</span></h4>
					<p>I'm currently learning a bit of Flask in Python.</p>

					<h3 id="sc31">Databases</h3>
					<h4>MongoDB <span class="skill-subhead">2 years</span></h4>
					<p>For the projects I've worked on, MongoDB has been a perfect fit for my purposes.</p>
					<h4>PostgreSQL <span class="skill-subhead">1 years</span></h4>
					<p>Postgres is certainly my go to SQL database, and I'm currently using it on 2 projects that are in development.</p>

					<h3 id="sc32">Server Administration</h3>
					<h4>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h4>
					<p>AWS is my go-to environment. For most servers, I run a pure EC2 instance, though I also have experience setting up EBS. Complementing this, I also frequently use S3 (Normal and Glacier), Route 53, and a few other services.</p>
					<h4>Firebase</h4>
					<p>I've used Firebase in a couple projects that needed easy authentication and simple data management.</p>
					<h4>Cloudflare</h4>
					<p>Most sites that I maintain myself use Cloudflare. I know how to use complex caching, DNS records, and Page Rules.</p>
					<h4>Ubuntu</h4>
					<p>I know how to set up a Ubuntu server from live-disk through security control. I'm knowledgable in setting up networking, iptables, fail2ban, and other security configuration. I've also used Debian a few times.</p>
					<h4>Windows Server</h4>
					<p>I have a good understanding of Windows Server, and the diagnostics and troubleshooting that come with it.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="sc4" class="">
					<h2>UI/UX</h2>
					<p>I've always enjoyed doing small graphic design projects, and from working in web development, UI and UX design have sort of grown out of it. I'm driven to create fluid and innovative interfaces, but I'm also not afraid to have my designs critiqued and put to the test.</p>

					<h3 id="sc41">Design</h3>
					<h4>Sketch (Design Application) <span class="skill-subhead">2 years</span></h4>
					<p>For most mobile and web mockups I've done, I've used Sketch. I'm very familiar with Sketch's vector tools, symbols, and exporting options.</p>
					<p>For a sample of my design work, contact me</p>

					<h4>Photoshop <span class="skill-subhead">6+ years</span></h4>
					<p>I've been using Photoshop for a very long time. I'm knowledgable in the complete set of tools it offers, including its photo editing, vector/shape, text, and even 3D tools.</p>
					<p>My main uses for Photoshop are graphic design and photography. For a sample of my work, contact me.</p>

					<h4>Other tools</h4>
					<p>Some other design tools I use are Google Fonts, Pttrns, Pexels, and Codrops. I keep myself up to date with design trends and standards like Material Design.</p>

					<h3 id="sc42">User Testing</h3>
					<p>I've been both the user and the tester in user testing sessions, so I know know to run tests well that get accurate, unbiased results.</p>
					<h4>Marvel (Prototypes)</h4>
					<p>I use Marvel in most prototypes that I create for user testing. I use the Sketch plugin that they offer.</p>
		        </section>
		        <section id="sc5" class="">
					<h2>Tools</h2>
					<p>Developing a site is only half the process, the other half is promoting it, improving it, and sometimes monetizing it.</p>

					<h3 id="sc51">SEO &amp; Ads</h3>
					<p>Every site I create is optimized for search. I use a variety of tools to ensure I get the highest visibility for relevant searches. I also am constantly looking for ways to improve SEO, for example by using Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), or using HTTPS.
					<h4>Google Search Console</h4>
					<p>GSC is the most efficient way of defining how Google sees a site.</p>
					<h4>Google AdWords and AdSense</h4>
					<p>I've used both AdWords and AdSense on sites. I've also used AdWords as an advertiser to promote a couple sites.</p>

					<h3 id="sc52">Analytics &amp; Diagnostics</h3>
					<h4>Chrome Developer Tools</h4>
					<p>Dev Tools in Chrome is the swiss army knife of web development. I usually constantly have it open when developing a site, and I'm very familiar with all aspects of it.</p>
					<h4>Google PageSpeed Insights</h4>
					<p>I use this to test sites for page load speed, as well as mobile compatibility.</p>
					<h4>Google Analytics</h4>
					<p>Analytics offers powerful tools that show how users interact with and use a site. I consistently evaluate the analytics of my sites and make changes accordingly.</p>

					<h3 id="sc53">Other</h3>
					<h4>Git</h4>
					<h4>Altassian Jira and SourceTree</h4>
					<h4>SQL Workbench</h4>
